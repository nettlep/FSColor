Readme.txt file for ColorBox.exe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ColorBox is intended to generate RGB-based colors for graphics programming and
manual web page creation (among other things.)

This program started off as a 15 minute project for a friend & co-worker. Do not
take offense to the middle-finger icon, as it's a personal joke to this person.

There's no documentation, as the UI is pretty self-explanatory.

This program was originally written by Paul Nettle (see "Other Credits" section
below), and is distributed from the following website:

  http://www.FluidStudios.com/

Any future enhancements will be publicized there.
