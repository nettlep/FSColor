# Legacy Code Resurrection Project

This file is part of a glorious rescue mission: migrating ancient code from the dusty vaults of the internet to the shiny halls of GitHub.

This code has been preserved as faithfully as possible, warts and all. All code contained herein is original code written by Paul Nettle unless otherwise noted.

## Original description

FSColor is a Color Picker tool for Windows that you can use in your own tools (it's a DLL.) There is also a pre-built executable if you just want to use it as a stand-alone tool. Of all the tools I've written over the years, this tool is the one I still use today and I use it all the time. It was updated for 64-bit processors in Jan 2014.

Adobe's PhotoShop product really nailed the color selection process on the head. I personally saw no need to improve on that, but I wanted a stand-alone tool that encompassed a few extra features (such as picking colors from the desktop & other windows, copying various color RGB formats to the clipboard, etc.) FSColor includes these features and more.

## Original Readme.txt

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Readme.txt file for ColorBox.exe
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ColorBox is intended to generate RGB-based colors for graphics programming and
    manual web page creation (among other things.)

    This program started off as a 15 minute project for a friend & co-worker. Do not
    take offense to the middle-finger icon, as it's a personal joke to this person.

    There's no documentation, as the UI is pretty self-explanatory.

    This program was originally written by Paul Nettle (see "Other Credits" section
    below), and is distributed from the following website:

      http://www.FluidStudios.com/

    Any future enhancements will be publicized there.

## Why preserve this?

Because history matters. This code is a snapshot of how things were done back then—and in some cases, how they’re still done today. Think of it as open source time travel.

Happy coding!
